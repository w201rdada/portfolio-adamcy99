## Formation of Potholes.

Talk about how potholes are formed and how having potholes is a problem. How would it benefit the government officail in the area? Good roads keep people happy.

## Sensors, sensors, sensors!

What type of sensors do we need? Temperature, humidity, rain, how often do the roads get wet. How much load is put onto the road (how much traffic goes through.) How many trucks and buses? Keep track of when the road was last fixed. Rank the roads in terms of priority based on the danger of it developing potholes, and also how much traffic goes through there. The idea is to set up a system to determine which roads are due for a pothole inspection. 


```{r experimental,echo=F,results='asis',eval=F}
data.table::fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCB-MIDS/experiments-causality/master/data/GerberGreenBook_Chapter3_Donations.csv?token=ABNmuX-Q14rzQ4teItDenc9L5Wo2flncks5ZL5qEwA%3D%3D') %>% stargazer::stargazer(type = 'html',title = 'Something from W241 Experiments and Causality')
```


## All about efficiency and Premptive strikes.

When potholes form, how long does it take for the officials to notice and come and fix it? Is it cheaper or easier to fix cracks before big potholes form or is it easier to fix them after they're big? it is safer to fix them when they're small. How do government officials know to come fix the pothole? Do people report them? They have to be pretty big for people to take notice and report them. It will make people happy if they stop running into big potholes. Also it will be good for everyone's safety.
