["Smarter-Fab.html", "1 Fabricating a Smarter Fab 1.1 Refocusing the Paradigm 1.2 Harnessing Machine Learning 1.3 A More Efficient System", " 1 Fabricating a Smarter Fab Keywords machine learning, semiconductors, fabrication, characterization, pattern recognition, efficiency, hardware, debugging 1.1 Refocusing the Paradigm When fabricating semiconductors, there are hundreds of process steps that might cause systematic electrical defects. These defects may cause chips to fail, resulting in lowered production yield (Turley 2003). Therefore, electrical data is collected at every process step in which an engineer will encounter specific characteristics that define a certain electrical defect. As more of these characteristics are discovered, they begin to paint a picture of what the defect is; the same way that symptoms give doctors an idea of what is ailing the patient. The microelectronics industry is currently reliant on a handful of engineers to be able to see such symptoms in the electrical data and proceed to diagnose the electrical defect. However, this is a paradigm that is too focused in the present. The symptoms of past electrical defects are either forgotten or tied to certain engineers who may not be with the company forever. There is also no way to use current electrical data to anticipate whether a past defect is in the process of reemerging. With data science and machine learning, we can shift the current inefficient paradigm, into one where electrical defects leave behind a history of their symptoms that can help with future diagnoses. Simultaneously, such implementations would be practical in uncovering previously unfound correlations to the current defect. 1.2 Harnessing Machine Learning The first step is to harness machine learning. After an engineer has developed a good grasp of the symptoms classifying a defect, such as: cells failing as adjacent vertical pairs on a swath stretching vertically across the wafer, they can put these symptoms into a classifier to try and correctly identify that electrical defect. The classifier will analyze the electrical data of each wafer that gets processed and try to label them as having the defect or not. During the training period, the expert engineers will look at those wafers to correct the classifier of any mislabeling. This will help the classifier adjust its parameters and figure out the best way to identify this defect. The classifier might even find other correlating symptoms between these wafers that the engineers were not aware of. Any new information can be crucial when trying to fix the process flow. After engineers confirm that the system is sufficiently trained for an accuracy above 90%, the classifier can analyze older wafers to label any that the engineers may have missed. Engineers can data-mine this list of unhealthy wafers against a healthy sample to identify which step in the process flow is triggering these defects. Once this defect has been fixed, there will be a historical record of it, which would be valuable if such a defect reemerges. Like a healthcare database for diseases, engineers can input a list of symptoms into the system and then come back with possible defects. This will be extremely beneficial even if it doesn’t diagnose the new defect exactly because it’ll provide clues as to where to start looking. Figure 1.1: Steps 2 to 4 can be improved with this machine learning method (Burkacky et al. 2018) 1.3 A More Efficient System This system, however, comes with limitations. Completely revamping the current way to do things is not easy and definitely takes time and training. Furthermore, the idea is to continually teach the system new defects that appear and store them indefinitely. All the storage created from this new system, combined with the massive amounts of electrical data that is already being collected will take a lot of server space. Big companies like IBM with their own servers, may be able to support this implementation, but without proof of concept of how much money this can save, stakeholders may be hesitant about implementation. Engineers might worry that they are training a machine learning algorithm that may eventually replace them. This however, is not the case because as long as better and faster devices are developed, new and evolved electrical defects will always appear. Therefore, engineers are an irreplaceable part of this system (Lucky 2016). If application of machine learning and big data is employed, the result is a more efficient fabrication paradigm. Engineers would be elevated to do their jobs better and faster all the while developing a catalog of all previous defects and their corresponding symptoms in the form of electrical data.

["Preventing-Potholes.html", "2 Plugging up Potholes with Data 2.1 Nuisances of the Road. 2.2 Learn, Execute, and Keep Learning! 2.3 All about efficiency and Preemptive strikes.", " 2 Plugging up Potholes with Data Keywords Potholes, Data Science, Fixing, Preemptive, Weather, Urban Improvement 2.1 Nuisances of the Road. Potholes: the asphalt nuisances that the everyday driver would have to dodge or else suffer an uncomfortable bump and the unease of possible damage done to their tires or rims. But a popped tire is the least of our problems when driving through a large pothole at the right speed may cause potentially fatal accidents. Current systems mostly rely on drivers reporting a pothole to the government usually before filing an insurance claim. In this case, it’s already too late because the pothole has already grown to a size where it can cause real damage to cars and be substantially costly to fix. In addition, it can take an average of 5.5 days in an affluent neighborhood in a state like Indiana for the repairs to start. In the poorer neighborhoods, it can take up to an average of 19 days (Criswell 2017). This can lead to a lot of discontent for the population of a city or town. Therefore, being able to fix cracks and small potholes before they grow would not only be beneficial for the drivers, but also for the government officials responsible for maintaining road quality. Imagine driving in your city or town and never encountering a pothole large enough to bother you. The resulting uptick in quality of life would theoretically translate to the popularity of the government official. By leveraging data science, it is possible to predict when a pothole is going to form and preemptively find and fix them when they are still small or merely cracks in the road. 2.2 Learn, Execute, and Keep Learning! The first step would be figuring out the basics with the information we have. Before we can predict when a pothole will form, we must first understand how they are formed. As roads get old, they usually suffer a degree of wear and tear as cracks start to emerge. In colder climates, as water seeps into these cracks and freeze, they will expand and subsequently compromise the integrity of the road much faster than usual. Many repetitions of this freezing and melting, combined with the weight of the cars passing over, will cause the road to weaken, crack and eventually form a pothole (“How Do Potholes Form?” 2009). Therefore, to predict when a pothole may form, we would need data on the weather, such as precipitation or snowfall. Temperature data would also be required to determine whether the water would freeze in the given area. Past maintenance records along with weather patterns should be studied and modeled to figure out the impact of each factor in creating a pothole. Figure 2.1: How Potholes Form (“How Do Potholes Form?” 2009) Figure 2.2: Number of potholes as a result of inches of snow (INFORMS 2018) The next step would be learning through execution. After we have some form of model, we can start preemptively fixing potholes but also build upon the model with new data. For example, it would be useful to have access to the average traffic of the area. This can be done by using traffic cameras to determine the average number of cars driving on the road in one day. Also, the number of trucks and buses can also be obtained in a similar way. This data might even be readily available because bus and truck routes are usually recorded. Other information such as the last date the road was inspected and repaired, the type of materials the road was paved with, and the frequency in which the road has to be repaired in the past should be integrated into the model in order to enhances the predictive accuracy. Using all this data, the model should be able to predict when a pothole may form so that officials can survey the road and fix any small potholes or cracks before they mature into a hindrance. Roads can also be ranked by priority in terms of the likelihood of developing potholes as well as the density of the traffic on that road. As a result, surveillance is only done when necessary, saving time and resources, but at the same time done early enough so that no pothole can grow to a size that bothers the drivers and is expensive to fix. 2.3 All about efficiency and Preemptive strikes. This approach however, does come with some limitations. No model is perfect, and no data is ever complete. Roads in some poorer neighborhoods might have fewer traffic cameras and therefore have incomplete data to work with. Consequently, the model might interpret these roads as lower priority based on the lack of data. It would be up to the government officials to realize and address these imperfections such as putting up a traffic camera where it’s needed. Furthermore, this preemptive solution might not even be an option for some cities that are already far behind in filling in existing potholes. It’s hard to find the time and resources to fill in potholes before they form when existing potholes haven’t been addressed yet. My recommendation is to tackle both problems simultaneously. Spend half of the time filling in existing potholes and the other half, preventing potholes from forming. Hopefully, the decreased rate in which large potholes form would give the city some breathing room to fill in existing potholes. On the whole however, especially in cities suited for this implementation, preemptively filling in potholes would not only increase quality of life and the popularity of the government officials, but also save the city some money. According to the director of the National Center for Pavement Preservation, “the cost of addressing minor deficiencies is much less than addressing major deficiencies” (Davis 2018). Furthermore, Pothole.info claims that “failure to spend $1 in road repair typically results in $7 of cost five years later” (“The Pothole Facts” 2018). It is true that implementing a data science system would cost money, but an early investment in fixing a problem can save a lot of money down the road. Bibliography "],
