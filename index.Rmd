### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

(ref:abs1) While working for IBM in semiconductor fabrication, I realized there is no great way to utilize all the patterns we, as engineers, accumulate when trying to figure out how an electrical defect is caused. Enter machine learning. By putting these symptoms we've observed from the electrical data, we can implement machine learning algorithms to help us label past and future wafers with this specific electrical defect. Yield is king when it comes to microelectronics, and electrical defects are the never-ending pests we must rid from our kingdom.

### Abstract of my second cool idea {-}

(ref:abs2) How many times do you come across a pothole in the middle of a road that you have to consciously avoid. If you fail to avoid the pothole, you suffer an excruciating bump and spend the next 5 minutes hoping you didn't damage your car. Well I believe the current system in fixing potholes after they grow to a large and annoying size is flawed. There can be so many benefits from predicting where potholes will form, sending a surveillance team out, and filling that pothole while it's still small or merely just cracks in the road. By implementing a predictive model driven by data of key variables such as snow fall and traffic weight, I believe we can prevent most potholes from plaguing the innocent driver.

## About the author {-}

Adam works as an electrical engineer for IBM after obtaining a bachelors from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and a masters from the Georgia Institute of Technology (both in the field of electrical engineering). While working for IBM, he quickly realized how important it is to be able to deal with large amounts of data in the tech industry. Upon reflection, it became clear that data science is a very versatile tool that can be applied to any type of job, which motivated Adam to pursue a Master of Information and Data Science degree from UC Berkeley. He has a special interest in machine learning and hopes to pursue that field in the future. Adam is a third culture kid, being a US citizen of Taiwanese heritage but spending most of his life growing up in Thailand. He has a twin brother and enjoys watching the NBA.
