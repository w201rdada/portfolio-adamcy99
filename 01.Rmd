## The Focus on Now Paradigm

Specific types of electrical defects can have very specific characteristics. We are stuck in a paradigm where we only care about the current electrical defect. Things we've seen before are either forgotten, or tied to certain engineers who may not be with the company forever. Also we have no way to anticipate a recurring problem in the future.

## Machine Learning in Improving the Process

We can use machine learning to to train an algorithm to identify each electrical defect that we've currently established a good understanding of. This can help keep track and label each new wafer that has the same defect.

## A More Efficient System

Hopefully the solution will result in a more efficient system all around. Allow engineers to do their jobs better and faster as well as developing a catalog of all defects seen and what they look like in terms of data. Limitations to this is that you have to continually teach the system new defects that appear and you have to consider how much space this all takes.
